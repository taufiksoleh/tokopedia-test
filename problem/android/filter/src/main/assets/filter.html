A sample of how to filter a list with existing json.<br/>

You are asked to improve the page by the following tasks.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li>
        Show list of products in a 2-column grid like illustration below:<br /><br />
        <img src="sample_image_list_filter.png" /><br /><br />
        (Products list is from products.json and you may create UI that is different from the illustration) <br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Create filter page.<br/> <br />
        Create a filter button in the list page. When this button is clicked, Filter Page (or Bottom Sheet) will be shown so user can configure the filter based on: <b>location</b> and <b>price</b>.<br/><br/>
        Location filter should use <a href="https://material.io/components/chips/">Choice chips</a>, single selection, and only show 3 options: (1) The location that appears most frequent in the list (2) The second most frequent item in the list, and (3) Other.<br/> <br />
        For example: <br/>
        Location:<br/>
        [Jakarta] [Bali] [Other]<br/><br/>
        This options should not be hardcoded.<br/><br/>
        Price Filter should be enable user to input min and maximum price (can use <a href="https://material.io/components/sliders/">Slider</a>). Min and max price is based on the product list and should not be hardcoded.<br/>
        For example:<br/>
        Min = 15000 (15000 is the minimum price in the list)<br/><br/>
        In the filter page, there will be a button to submit the filter configuration. If this submit button is clicked, the product list will reflect the change according to the given input.<br/><br/>
    </li>

        Don't add new library.
    </li>
